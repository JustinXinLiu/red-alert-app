This little demo was created to experiment touch interactions on a PWA by showing your high importance emails from your Outlook ([Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The gestures were implemented with [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring) and the authentication was powered Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript ([MSAL.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)).

In the project directory, run:

### `npm i`

to install all the packages. And then do:

### `npm start`

to run the project. 

It was designed to fit on a phone screen only.
